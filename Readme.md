# School of solana season 7 parent repo

This repository serves as a single entry point to multiple independent tasks, included here as **Git submodules**.  

## Cloning With Submodules
Clone this repository **with all submodules** in one step:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Tochy112/school-of-solana-s7-tasks.git

```
If you already cloned without the --recurse-submodules flag, initialize and fetch submodules like so:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
